This is [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

The project only aims to exemplify how to blur elements in a performant and creative way over images with bare React Native code.

If you require new features or bug fixes you can fork this project, but consider starring this repository and mention the credits.

All the concept behind the logic is going to be explained soon in my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@ggraeff).

Some usage examples (heavy file can take seconds to load):

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

You can start the application by running:
